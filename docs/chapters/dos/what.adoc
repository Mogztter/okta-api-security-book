= Types of Denial of Service Attacks

There are three main types of DoS attacks:

== 1. Application-layer Flood

In this attack type, an attacker simply floods the service with requests from a spoofed IP address in an attempt to slow or crash the service, illustrated in .
This could take the form of millions of requests per second or a few thousand requests to a particularly resource-intensive service that eat up resources until the service is unable to continue processing the requests.

Preventing application-layer DoS attacks can be tricky. The best way to help mitigate these types of attacks is to outsource pattern detection and IP filtering to a third party (discussed later).
